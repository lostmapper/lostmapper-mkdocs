## About Me

My name is Brian, and I am the Lost Mapper.

I am a self-taught hobbyist mapper trying to learn more about GIS and cartography by teaching others through YouTube videos and blog posts. I've always found that trying to teach something forces you to make sure you really understand it first.

You can reach me at [brian@lostmapper.com](mailto:brian@lostmapper.com). My personal website is <https://spilth.org>.
